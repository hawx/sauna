- On edit screens make inline labels check if text exists in an input.
- Create a background, page style, same colour as now, add pages rotated at different angles to add depth.
- Make it so that going to an id url eg. /post/:id or /discussion/:id or /tag/:id redirects to the name version and also redirects correctly so that posts end up in the correct discussion.
- Allow members to be banned for a certain period of time.
- Add email system using pony? So members don't have to have their email address shown.
- Make a new model called 'Mention' so that when a member is mentioned in a post or comment they are notified, maybe by email but at have a list on their member page.

# NOTE
It seems either datamapper or sqlite3 is broken as it keeps giving issues, best plan is to create a new branch, find problem then merge. But it is quite probable that the problem isn't with me, but the __gems__.
